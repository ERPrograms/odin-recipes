        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb large shrimp (peeled and deveined)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional for a little heat)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for spice)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley (chopped, for garnish)</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges (for serving, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels and season with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp to the skillet in a single layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp are pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and let it melt. Stir in the lemon juice and red pepper flakes (if using), then let the sauce simmer for 1-2 minutes, scraping up any bits of shrimp left in the pan.</li>
            <li>Return the shrimp to the skillet and toss them in the garlic butter sauce until fully coated and heated through.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for added freshness. Enjoy over pasta, rice, or with your favorite sides!</li>
