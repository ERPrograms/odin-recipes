            <li>1 lb Ground Beef (or italian sausage)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (15 oz) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried)</li>
            <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 grated parmasean cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain them and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef (or Italian sausage) over medium heat until browned. Break up the meat with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the meat. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until the onions are softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Mix well and simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to blend. Add fresh parsley towards the end.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and 1/2 cup of the shredded mozzarella. Stir until smooth and well mixed. This will form the creamy layer of your lasagna.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Then, add a layer of the ricotta mixture, followed by more sauce, and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat these layers (noodles, ricotta, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of sauce and cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil, making sure the foil doesn't touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna sit for about 10-15 minutes after baking. This helps the layers set, making it easier to slice and serve.</li>
            <li>Slice into squares, garnish with extra parsley if desired, and serve warm!</li>
        </ol>
